# spin-flip

All code in the spin dynamics folder is from research that I did in the summer of 2014 on All optical Ultrafast Magnetization Reversal. This is an application of Femtomagnetism which is a sub field of Quantum Magnetism. The specific purpose of my reseach was to find a possible explanation for the experimental results found by C.D. Stanciu et al. in 2007. This research was supervised by Dr. GouPing Zhang at Indiana State University. The Presented results can be found in the Physics-and-Applied-Math2 repository under APS March Meeting 2.pptx and Symposium.pptx.
